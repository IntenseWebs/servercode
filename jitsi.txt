# Copy Docker Compose and Environment Files
# We'll make copies of two of the files to work from. First, let's copy the 'env.example' file to a new hidden file called '.env'. This is the file docker compose uses by default for configurations.

cp env.example .env

Next, let's copy the docker-compose.yml file to a new file called 'compose.yaml' (this is the newer naming convention used by Docker Compose). Then we'll rename the original file by adding a '.bak' extension to the end, so Docker Compose will default to our 'compose.yaml' file.

cp docker-compose.yml compose.yaml

'mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.bak'
